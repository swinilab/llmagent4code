# Overview
Design and implement a production-grade, backend-only e-commerce Order Management System (OMS).
Structure your response strictly as: Context → Architecture → Tasks → Deliverables → Output.

---

# Context
You are building a OMS backend that serves the APIs for the complete workflow: customer ordering → payment processing → invoicing → shipping → closure. The system serves three roles (Customer, Order Staff, Accountant) and must handle non-trivial traffic. No authentication is required.

# Architectural Design Requirements

## 1. Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
For every major architectural choice you MUST provide a short ADR entry containing:
- **Decision:** what you chose
- **Context:** which NFR(s) it addresses
- **Alternatives considered:** at least 2 other options and why they were rejected
- **Consequences:** trade-offs accepted

## 2. NFR Traceability Matrix (MANDATORY)
Before writing any code, produce a table mapping every NFR below to:
- The **architectural mechanism** you will use to satisfy it.
- The **module/component** where it lives
- A one-line **verification method** (how a reviewer would confirm it works)

Non-Functional Requirements to satisfy:
- **NFR 2.1 Graceful Degradation:** Under extreme resource contention, the system must degrade non-essential features to ensure core checkout functionality remains available.
- **NFR 2.2 Fault Detection and Recovery:** The application must detect internal component failures and automatically attempt to recover or reconnect, minimizing user-facing errors.
- **NFR 2.3 State Preservation:** In the event of an unexpected application process crash, the system must be able to restore its operational state and resume processing pending orders upon restart with minimal data loss.

---

# Domain Model (complete definitions required)
- **Customer:** id, name, address, phone, banking details, order history, role.
- **Order:** id, customer ref, line items, amounts, status (enum with full lifecycle), timestamps, invoice ref.
- **Product:** id, description, pricing (base + currency).
- **Payment:** id, order ref, amount, timestamp, status, method.
- **Invoice:** id, order ref, billing info, amounts, issue/due dates, status.

---

# User Workflow (must be implemented)
1. Customer places order.
2. Order Staff reviews & accepts.
3. Accountant creates invoice for accepted order.
4. Customer pays invoice.
5. Accountant verifies payment.
6. Order Staff ships paid order.
7. Order Staff closes completed order.

---

# Backend Requirements
Per entity produce three **complete** layers:
- **Service** (business logic, transaction boundaries, orchestration of cross-cutting concerns)
- **Controller** (REST endpoints, request/response mapping, validation)
- **Routing / API definition** (OpenAPI-friendly, versioned paths)

---

# Infrastructure Requirements
Provide complete, runnable artifacts to install and deploy on local machine as a production environment.

---

# Code Quality & Conciseness Rules
- **No placeholders, no "repeat this pattern", no `// ... similar for other fields`.** Every file must be complete and runnable.
- **Be concise:** Do not pad with boilerplate.
- **Prefer composition over inheritance.** Extract shared behavior into utilities/hooks/base classes rather than duplicating.

---

# Deliverables Checklist (every item must appear in the output)
1. NFR Traceability Matrix.
2. ADRs for major decisions.
3. Data architecture narrative + complete schema.
4. Shared domain models (used by both FE and BE).
5. Complete backend code: entities, repositories, services, controllers, config, OpenAPI spec.
6. IaC config and documents.
7. Local deployment guide.
8. Verification steps showing how to observe each NFR being satisfied.

---

# Output Requirements
- Produce **complete, functional code** for every component listed — no abbreviations.
- Organize the response with clear headers matching the sections above.
- Where a file is long, still emit it in full; do not truncate.
- Every cross-cutting concern must be **visible in code**, not only described in prose.
